# Project Movie Trailer website

Project Movie Trailer website utilizes server side code (fresh_tomatoes.py)
to display six of my favorite movies on a dynamically generated website
where the data for these movies are stored using Classes.  The data for the
movies is contained in the entertainment_center.py file and the "Movie" Class
in contained in the media.py file.

## Instructions

1) Install Python 2.7.x. Instructions for installing Python can be found
  [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
2) Download and install these three files from GitHUb to a PC that has Python
  installed to the same directory.  These three files are:

    1) fresh_tomatores.py
    2) entertainment_center.py
    3) media.py

The GitHub URL is: (https://github.com/msmith7970/Movie_Trailer_Website.git)

Once these three files are installed and to see the results, follow pythons
normal practice to run the file called 'entertainment_center.py'.

## Usage
The file entertainment.py contains the information to define the instance of
six movie titles.  

The six pieces of information for each movie instance are:

    1) Movie Title
    2) Storyline
    3) The movies poster image
    4) the Youtube URL of the movie trailer
    5) the index to the global variable called VALID_RATINGS that contains
       the rating of the movie (where 0 = 'G', 1 = 'PG', 2 = 'PG-13 and 3 = 'R'
    6) the ratings given to a movie from the Rotten Tomatoes website as defined
       as the Tomatometer.

The file fresh_tomatoes.py is file that displays all the instance of a movie as
defined from the enterainment.py file into a format that is easily viewed
as a HTML file in a web browser.

The media.py file defines the Movie class and initializes the data
associated with the instance.
